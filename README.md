# Mews Onboarding

This is a simplified Flutter demo that walks a user through a short hotel
onboarding flow.  A chat style interface asks the user for a few details and
then generates a small demo dashboard.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for an overview of the code
structure and contribution guidelines.

## Getting Started

Install Flutter and run the application with:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

The web version will launch with hot reload enabled.  Additional demo pages can
be accessed via `/booking`, `/front-desk` and `/housekeeping`.
